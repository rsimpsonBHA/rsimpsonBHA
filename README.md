Hi, Racquel here and welcome to my ReadMe. This is an evolving document. So stay tuned as I divulge more and more with time. This tea is pipping hot! Kidding, this will forever remain professional. All the juicy intel is reserved for coffee breaks (virtually and occassionally in person).
# ✨ My Role ✨
- I get to be a rockstar daily ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df3afad5-af5c-49db-a008-c1e3f488c638) (or a dancehall queen depending on the day). Essentially, my role as a Program Manager allows me to be a superstar as I flow in innovation through uncharted territory. In my role I work with strategic partners such as Ontario Health, the Black Physicians' of Ontario, community health organizations and other health organizations across the province to drive the implementation of the provincial Black Health Plan.

# My favourite cuisine
- All that is flavourful and well seasoned! Lol! Aside from Caribbean food, I enjoy Thai, Vietnamese, tasty vegan dishes, and Ghanian peanut soup.
# ⚡ Fun fact:
- I took a course in jazz vocals. I was absolutely mesmorized by the creativity of scatting. I also used to play percussion as a teenager. It was my form of rebellion.
